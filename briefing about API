Application programming Interface (API ) :
It is used to make communication between two or more application backend system.
It uses some protocols and rules to communicate between two systems.
Using API it is not required to write code of the others systems , we can access them using an API KEY, This makes easy to develop systems.
One system sends the query to other system using API KEY , The other system receives the query and process it and returns the result to the main system.
